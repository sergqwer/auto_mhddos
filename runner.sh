##### It is possible to pass arguments "num_of_copies" and "restart_interval" to script.
##### curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarboDuck/runner.sh/master/runner.sh | bash -s -- 2 1800 (launch with num_of_copies=2 and restart_interval=1800)

##### To kill script just close terminal window. OR. In other terminal run 'pkill -f python3'. And press CTRL+C in main window.



## Restart script every N seconds (900s = 15m, 1800s = 30m, 3600s = 60m).
## It allows to download updates for mhddos_proxy, MHDDoS and target list.
## By default (9m), can be passed as second parameter
restart_interval="9m"
